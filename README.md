## Goal

This project aims to give you two things:

1. A first exposure to working on a real app in Xcode
2. A chance to apply your new knowledge of the basic principles of Swift

The repository already contains a fully-featured app, **Choosey**, that helps users decide where to eat. As a part of today's meeting, you will be adding a couple of features to help make the user-experience *great*.

## Installation

Here are the steps to get the starter repo for this project onto your machine and opened with Xcode.

1. Clone this repository onto your computer. I recommend that you create a new directory specifically for your App Team Carolina work. Run the following command in your Terminal (while "cd'ed" into your App Team directory) to clone this repo:

   ```bash
   # git clone https://github.com/appteamcarolina/p01-choosey.git
   ```

2. Open the `p01-choosey.xcodeproj` file with Xcode.

### Setup

This project uses the [Yelp Business Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search) to search for restaurants in Chapel Hill. Because of this, we'll need to do some setup to  allow you to run this project on your laptop.

1. Find the folder called `Service` in the Xcode file directory and press the toggle.
